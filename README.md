# Snap

Welcome to Snap

Within this game there are 3 modes:
1. One player - Play by yourself, if you get a snap by the time the deck runs out, then you win the game!

2. Two players - Play with a friend! If a snap comes available, type snap before the 3 second timer runs out and you get a point! But if you're too slow your opponent gets the point instead...
3. Vs computer - Here, you and the computer take it in turns to play. If a snap comes available type snap within 3 seconds or else you'll lose!
